  SOLUTION TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS.TXT ERROR
================================================================================

YOUR ERROR:
-----------
ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
PS C:\Users\User\Downloads\blank-app-main (1)>

WHAT I'VE DONE:
---------------
I've updated the repository with the following fixes:

1. ✅ Created automated setup scripts (setup.bat for Windows, setup.sh for Linux/Mac)
2. ✅ Updated README.md with detailed installation and troubleshooting steps
3. ✅ Created SETUP_HELP.md - comprehensive troubleshooting guide
4. ✅ Created WINDOWS_FIX.md - quick fix specifically for Windows users
5. ✅ Verified requirements.txt is valid (20 packages, properly formatted)

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
--------------------

OPTION 1 - EASIEST (Recommended):
1. Re-download or re-clone this repository to get the latest files
2. Navigate to the project folder in PowerShell
3. Run: .\setup.bat
4. Done! The script handles everything automatically

OPTION 2 - MANUAL FIX:
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory:
   cd "C:\Users\User\Downloads\blank-app-main (1)"

2. Verify requirements.txt exists:
   dir requirements.txt

3. If the file exists, run these commands:
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

4. If the file is missing, you need to re-download the complete repository

OPTION 3 - CREATE THE FILE MANUALLY:
If you can't re-download, create a file named "requirements.txt" with this content:

streamlit
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-huggingface
PyPDF2
pypdf
faiss-cpu
sentence-transformers
huggingface_hub>=0.20.0
transformers
torch
numpy
pandas
plotly
scikit-learn
nltk
bert-score
evaluate
rouge-score
sacrebleu

Then run:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
The requirements.txt file exists in the repository, but it's not present in your 
local directory. This usually happens when:
- Incomplete download or extraction of the repository
- Being in the wrong directory
- ZIP file extraction issues

FILES YOU SHOULD HAVE:
----------------------
After downloading the repository, you should see these files:
✓ requirements.txt       (package dependencies)
✓ streamlit_app.py      (main application)
✓ setup.bat             (Windows setup script - NEW)
✓ setup.sh              (Linux/Mac setup script - NEW)
✓ README.md             (documentation - UPDATED)
✓ SETUP_HELP.md         (troubleshooting guide - NEW)
✓ WINDOWS_FIX.md        (Windows quick fix - NEW)
✓ LICENSE               (license file)

ABOUT THE PIP NOTICE:
---------------------
The notice "[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.0.1 -> 25.3" is not 
an error - it's just informational. To fix it, run:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

The setup.bat script now does this automatically.

QUICK START AFTER SETUP:
------------------------
Once dependencies are installed:
1. Get a HuggingFace API token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Run: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
3. Open your browser to: http://localhost:8501
4. Enter your API token in the sidebar
5. Upload PDF files and start evaluating!

NEED MORE HELP?
---------------
- See WINDOWS_FIX.md for Windows-specific quick fix
- See SETUP_HELP.md for comprehensive troubleshooting
- See README.md for full documentation

VERIFICATION:
-------------
I've verified that:
✅ requirements.txt exists and is valid
✅ Contains 20 packages (no duplicates or errors)
✅ File is properly formatted (ASCII text, Unix line endings)
✅ Pip can successfully parse the file
✅ Setup scripts have proper error checking
✅ All documentation files are in place

The repository is ready to use. Just download it again and follow Option 1 above!
